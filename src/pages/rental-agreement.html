Extended times for all rentals must be cleared with the chauffeur in advance and are subject to availability

Filing a written complaint insures both parties fully understood what the problem was. The customer will be contacted within (7) seven business days of the complaint to settle the matter. The customer understands that this is a separate case from the main contract and therefore will not dispute the payments authorized to A2Z Limos. 
						</div>

							Since A2Z Limos offers high-tech-equipped vehicles, sometimes heat and excessive use of all power-operated equipment might be subject to temporary failure.

Vehicle stays at the prom location while students are at the prom (there is no riding around for students not even to the store, etc.). After the prom, vehicle can make 1 stop for the party before it starts making drop offs (3 maximum). Vehicles do NOT drive around. Each vehicle needs a destination. Each additional stop will be $35/Sedan limos or $50/SUV limos extra per stop. There is no breaking apart of the group for the After-Prom Party. Vehicle stays where the majority of the group got off for the stop. There is no riding around to other locations while most of the group got off at the stop. As with all contracts, the rental contract between the mentioned person as renter and A2Z Limos is made with the information and the terms given to us. Contracted price is set for contracted pickups, addresses, time and number of passengers. As indicated in the contract, any extra un-accounted passengers traveling in the vehicle are subject to extra charge or denial on getting onboard. All of the given information from the renter is binding and cannot be changed without A2Z Limos acceptance. If the contract is cancelled or accepted after it is signed, A2Z Limos is still authorized to collect the remaining balance in full, if the car was not re-rented again on the cancelled date for the same or higher amount. The credit card holder gives authorization to use the credit card information. If the customer doesn’t pay the full amount of the remaining balance ,A2Z Limos will not start the job. Therefore the risk of not getting paid will give us the right to cancel. The customer is still fully responsible to pay the total amount as he failed to provide the above requirements. A2Z Limos rates are billed, including, applicable fees and a 25% service charge. If you feel that you would like to provide an additional gratuity to the driver it is at your sole discretion. If you choose to provide an additional cash gratuity; it is at your sole discretion, and is in addition to the 25% you have already paid for. You will not receive a full or partial refund for the 25% Service Charge by providing a cash tip to the Chauffeur. A2Z Limos cannot guarantee the availability of additional hours for any extended time.
